# Volkswagen Group Car Catalog SPA

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and Zustand to manage a catalog of Volkswagen Group cars. It supports CRUD operations via a mocked REST API using JSON Server. The architecture follows DDD principles with a layered approach and a focus on Clean Code and maintainability.

## 📐 Architectural Decisions

### 1. Repository Pattern

To decouple the application logic from data access and improve maintainability, we applied the **Repository Pattern**. All use cases (e.g., `fetchCarsUseCase`, `createCarUseCase`, etc.) depend on the domain-defined interface `CarRepository`. The actual implementation `CarApiRepository` is injected from infrastructure.

**Benefits:**

- 💡 **Separation of concerns**: Use cases know nothing about HTTP or persistence.
- 🔁 **Swap implementations easily**: The repository can switch from REST API to local storage or IndexedDB.
- 🧪 **Better testability**: Tests mock the repository instead of network calls.

### 2. HTTP Adapter

The actual HTTP logic (with `fetch`, `try/catch`, headers, etc.) is encapsulated in a dedicated file:
`src/infrastructure/http/http.car.ts`.

This adapter is used internally by `CarApiRepository` and contains all the side-effect logic.

```txt
use-cases/              ← Application layer
  fetchCarsUseCase.ts
  ...

domain/
  models/
  repositories/         ← CarRepository interface

infrastructure/
  http/http.car.ts      ← HTTP adapter with try/catch
  repositories/
    CarApiRepository.ts ← Implements CarRepository using http.car.ts
```

### 3. Test Strategy

All use cases are unit tested using mocked repositories (`CarApiRepository`).
We no longer mock `fetch` in those tests, ensuring:

- Less coupling to implementation
- Consistent behavior
- Better alignment with Clean Architecture principles

## 🤖 AI Tool Usage

This project was developed using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [GitHub Copilot] for productivity support.

- ChatGPT was used to scaffold architectural decisions, refine TypeScript types, and generate boilerplate logic for UI and tests.
- Developer input focused on domain modeling (Volkswagen cars), DDD structure, and test refinement.

All AI-generated code was reviewed and adjusted manually to meet best practices and project requirements.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- **Unit tests** for all use cases and business logic
- **Integration tests** for CarForm, DataTable, and UI interactions
- **Mocks** replace API calls in tests

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

# Volkswagen DDD React App

## 📦 Project Overview

This project is a front-end web application simulating a car catalogue for the Volkswagen Group. It follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and is built using React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and Zustand for state management. The app includes full CRUD operations powered by a mock API via JSON Server.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **React 18 + Vite** for fast dev experience
- **TypeScript** for static typing
- **TailwindCSS** for UI styling
- **Zustand** for global state
- **Vitest + React Testing Library** for testing
- **JSON Server** as mocked backend
- **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** layered architecture

## 🗂️ Architecture

- `domain/`: Entities, Value Objects
- `application/`: Use cases (business logic)
- `infrastructure/`: API and DTOs
- `ui/`: Components, pages, and styling
- `state/`: Global Zustand store

## 📑 DDD Refactors

### 🔹 Value Object: `Power`

Introduced a `Power` Value Object to encapsulate the `horsepower` field.

#### Why:

- Enforces that horsepower is a positive number.
- Can expose extra functionality like unit conversion or formatting (e.g. `"150 CV"`).
- Immutable and ensures better domain integrity.

```ts
const power = Power.create(150);
power.getValue(); // 150
power.toString(); // "150 CV"
```

#### Validation:

```ts
Power.create(-10); // Throws error
```

### 🔹 DTO: `CarDTO`

A `CarDTO` object has been created to separate domain (`CarModel`) from infrastructure.

#### Why:

- Prevents leaking domain logic to the API.
- Avoids serialization issues with complex types like `Power`.
- Makes testing easier by using plain objects.

#### Conversion helpers:

```ts
// Convert to domain
const model = toCarModel(dto);

// Convert to DTO
const dto = toCarDTO(model);
```

These are located in `infrastructure/dto/carDTO.ts`.

## 🤖 AI Tool Usage

- **ChatGPT** was used to:
  - Define initial architecture
  - Draft README and documentation
  - Generate test templates and DTO logic
  - Review and debug Value Object design
- Developer made manual decisions on folder structure, implementation details, testing strategy, and DDD adherence.

## 📐 Design Decisions

- Value objects introduced only where semantic domain value applies (e.g. `Power` for `horsepower`).
- DTOs help decouple external interfaces from internal domain.
- Zustand preferred over Redux for simplicity and flexibility.

## 📋 Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🔌 Mock API with JSON Server

npx json-server --watch db.json --port 4000
```

## ✅ Testing

  - Use cases
  - API adapters

## 🚀 CI/CD

- Tests are integrated and designed for future GitHub Actions CI pipeline.

## ♿ Accessibility & UX/UI Improvements

Throughout the development of the Volkswagen DDD React App, we incorporated several accessibility (a11y) and user experience (UX/UI) enhancements to ensure better usability across devices and user needs.

### ✅ Form Accessibility

- **Proper use of `<label>`**:
  - All form fields are now associated with visible or screen-reader-friendly `<label>` elements (`htmlFor` + `id`).
- **Improved keyboard navigation**:
  - Inputs are logically ordered and focusable.
- **Use of `required` and `aria-required`**:
  - Both HTML5 validation and ARIA attributes used for assistive technologies.
- **Semantic grouping with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`**:
  - Helps screen readers contextualize related form fields.
- **Autocomplete hints**:
  - Added `autoComplete` attributes for better form completion.

### ✅ Table Improvements

- **Sortable table headers are now buttons**:
  - Replaced `<div>`s with `<button>` in `<th>` for full keyboard and screen reader support.
- **Added `scope="col"` to `<th>` elements**:
  - Improves semantics and accessibility.
- **Accessible search input**:
  - Paired with a visually hidden `<label>` and uses `aria-label` for clarity.
- **Responsive table layout**:
  - Table layout adapts to screen size with column visibility adjustments (`hidden md:table-cell`).

### ✅ Car Detail Responsiveness (`CarShowcase`)

- **Dual layout based on screen size**:
  - On **desktop**: `CarShowcase` appears to the right of the table in a sidebar layout.
  - On **mobile**: It slides in as a full-width overlay modal for focused interaction.
- **Accessible modal behavior on mobile**:
  - Includes `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` (ready for further enhancement).
- **"Editar" button on mobile**:
  - Allows seamless transition from viewing to editing a car, auto-loading the selected car into the form.

### 🔁 State-driven UI

- Interaction between `CarShowcase`, the form modal, and the table is managed via the Zustand store for consistent global state.

---

These improvements ensure that the app is more inclusive, user-friendly, and responsive across devices, aligning with modern web standards and accessibility guidelines.
